        The main story for the game Identity V is told through the perspective of the ex-novelist Detective Orpheus,
        <br> who has been commissioned to find Mr. Reichenbach's missing daughter. However, the mystery deepens as he finds and reads 
        <br> series of mysterious diaries within Oletus Manor. It soon becomes apparent that a strange game was held within the manor,
        <br> where people risk their lives in order to obtain a wish or reward of their deepest desire.
        <br> It also becomes clear that Orpheus has his own secrets.
